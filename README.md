Description: A web application that integrates some of the features of Glassdoor and CrunchBase (using their public API's) to provide a more efficient job search tool. This is also our Fall 2015 CS 411 Final Project. 

Team members include Karunya Tota, Cindy Hernandez, and Jacob Waterman. 

In order to run the application, type 'python manage.py runserver' into command line.

Test.py contains the script for crawling the Glassdoor and CrunchBase API's particularly for San Francisco companies.
